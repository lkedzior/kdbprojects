How the clocks work
1) timer - licznik uaktualniany w czasie prerwan, accurate but precission is around 1ms on windows

2) peformance counter
counter of cpu ccycles, there are now special chips on motherboards which just do cycles counting
resolution ~100ns or 0.1 microsecond

Clocks normally use combinations of both 1) & 2) to get the time
